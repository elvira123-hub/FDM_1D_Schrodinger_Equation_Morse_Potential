# Numerical-solution-of-the-1D-Schrodinger-equation-with-Morse-Potential
understanding and resolving numerically the 1D schr√∂dinger equation for a Morse potential. This requires to get a good potential energy surface (PES) and suitable numerical recipes. For that, I used Crank-Nicholson method as a useful tool for obtaining numerical solutions.
