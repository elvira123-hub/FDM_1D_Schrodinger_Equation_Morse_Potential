# Numerical solution of the TISE 
Due to the complicated form of the Schrödinger equation, there are some examples where it doesn't exists an analytical solution to the problem.
the motivation of this repository is to solve the Schrödinger equation numerically under a Morse potential by using finite difference method and matrix operator.
